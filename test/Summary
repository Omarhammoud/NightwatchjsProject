For the assignment, I wrote 4 different test cases, the first one will successfully login and do a text validation by validating that
the string "Welcome :)" is on the screen. The second test does the same but with image validation, which is a screenshot of the screen.
The last 2 tests are the same as the first 2 but the login is made to fail.
